# TODO
- [ ] Need to decide timeline of analysis
- [ ] Convert percentage voted to be a percentage and not large decimal? Should be 0 - 1 not 0 - 100
- [ ] For 2013 get percentage of groups with 0 - 1 values
- [ ] Need to choose how to fill data for years that are missing a percentage for voting except 2013 just use census data (back and forward filling it?)
- [ ] Clean up the non political data for any missing values and change their datatypes to make more sense.
- [ ] Complete PA4
- [ ] Update proposal with the following: Focus on FBiH and its fragmentation in ethnicity, using voting data as a proxy. New story: ethnic fragmentation (more diversity in the context of BiH) leads to more conflict (political, physical?) and results in lower municpal wage growth. My hypothesis is that areas with higher ethnic diversity will experience slower wage growth than those that have a clear dominant group. Listen to the podcast Kyle recommended and read the paper if it is applicable. https://www.aeaweb.org/research/cultural-distance-ethnic-conflict
- [ ] Need to understand the political structure of BiH and FBiH. Specifically, do municipalities send any type of representatives at the entity or national level? Is power shared at this level or only at a presedential/national level? Do municipalities have ethnic quotas? Do all levels of government have them too? https://search.brave.com/search?q=bosnia+and+herzegovina+political+system&source=web&summary=1&conversation=c776a6fe75d352d60acc73
- [ ] How does presidential voting work in BiH? Can anyone vote for anybody?
