# TODO
- [ ] Rename variables after PA4 (Use Full Names from PA4 but for which df??)
- [ ] Update proposal with the following: Focus on FBiH and its fragmentation in ethnicity, using voting data as a proxy. New story: ethnic fragmentation (more diversity in the context of BiH) leads to more conflict (political, physical?) and results in lower municpal wage growth. My hypothesis is that areas with higher ethnic diversity will experience slower wage growth than those that have a clear dominant group. Listen to the podcast Kyle recommended and read the paper if it is applicable. https://www.aeaweb.org/research/cultural-distance-ethnic-conflict
- [ ] Find literature that supports the use of HHI in your ethnic concentration and political fragmentation vars
- [ ] Use the following as additional evidence for assuming ethnic to political connection: https://www.bmz.de/en/countries/bosnia-and-herzegovina/political-situation-91748
- [ ] Make sure to properly cite https://www.geoboundaries.org/#tabs1-html in paper
- [ ] Add a license
- [ ] Simplifiy dependencies into one conda file
- [ ] Report bug to https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries/issues or fix it yourself for Istoƒçni Stari Grad being in FBiH entities when it is an RS entity. Look at how to contribute yourself.
