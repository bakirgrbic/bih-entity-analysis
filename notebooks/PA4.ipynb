    "`ethnic`: This variable (more of a constant) was created by taking 2013 census data on Bosniak, Croat, and Serb to get the percentage of each group from their total in a municipality. I then transformed this to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) because it measures the share of ethnicities in a municipality and seemed more appropriate than the gini index which can be used to measure inequality. This transformation also has the benefit of focusing on the balance of ethnicities and not on the exact percentages of a single ethnicity which may lead to some bad conclusions if run through a model (such as one ethniciites higher concentration increasing wages more than others). Since there are three ethnic groups, the lowest value this variable can hold is 0.33 and the highest is 1.0.\n",

    "`political`: This variable was created by first scraping the municipal level data for the 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022 presidential elections in BiH for FBiH. BiH has a three presidents that rotate in their duties, one for each major ethnic group. Voters in FBiH vote for the Bosniak and Croat candidates and candidates must affiliate with one of those two identities to run in FBiH. This allowed me get the percentage of voters that voted for a Bosniak and Croat candidate regardless of what party a candidate belonged to. After getting those percentages, I linearly interpolated missing percentage values for years there was not an election so I could build a similar vairable to `ethnic` and did the same HHI transformation. Since there are only two groups this time, the lowest value for this variable can be 0.5 and the highest 1.0.\n",

My current working hypothesis is that areas with higher ethnic diversity, lower values of ethnic and political index variables, in BiH will experience less growth due to having more conflict as a result of not having a single dominant group in a municipality. From my correlation matrix, it looks like both of these variables are slightly negatively correlated with my dependent variable as I would expect from my hypothesis and the literature. In my choroleth maps it does also appear that some regions are very correlated with their ethnic index and their political index, indicating that areas with higher concentrations of one ehnicity vote for one type of presidential candidate.\n",

My idea was that municipalities with higher percentages of these businesses would likely employee workers that do not need specialized skills or knowledge compared to other industries. The correlation value with my dependent variable is very small and I'd argue very close to zero although the sign is what I would expect.\n",
